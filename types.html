        <h2>Convolutional Neural Network</h2>
        <p>A convolutional neural network(CNN) uses a variation of the multilayer
           perceptrons. A CNN contains one or more than one convolutional layers.
           These layers can either be completely interconnected or pooled.
           Before passing the result to the next layer, the convolutional layer
           uses a convolutional operation on the input. Due to this convolutional
           operation, the network can be much deeper but with much fewer
           parameters.
           Due to this ability, convolutional neural networks show very effective
           results in image and video recognition, natural language processing,
           and recommender systems
           Convolutional neural networks also show great results in semantic
           parsing and paraphrase detection. They are also applied in signal
           processing and image classification.
           CNNs are also being used in image analysis and recognition in
           agriculture where weather features are extracted from satellites like
           LSAT to predict the growth and yield of a piece of land. Here’s an
           image of what a Convolutional Neural Network looks like.</p>

        <h2>Feed Foward Network</h2>
        <p>This is one of the simplest types of artificial neural networks. In a
          feedforward neural network, the data passes through the different input
          nodes till it reaches the output node.
          In other words, data moves in only one direction from the first tier
          onwards until it reaches the output node. This is also known as a front
          propagated wave which is usually achieved by using a classifying
          activation function.
          Unlike in more complex types of neural networks, there is no
          backpropagation and data moves in one direction only. A feedforward
          neural network may have a single layer or it may have hidden layers.
          In a feedforward neural network, the sum of the products of the inputs
          and their weights are calculated. This is then fed to the output. Here
          is an example of a single layer feedforward neural network.

        <h2>Multilayer Perceptron</h2>
        <p>A multilayer perceptron has three or more layers. It is used to
          classify data that cannot be separated linearly. It is a type of
          artificial neural network that is fully connected. This is because
          every single node in a layer is connected to each node in the following
          layer.
          A multilayer perceptron uses a nonlinear activation function
          (mainly hyperbolic tangent or logistic function). Here’s what a
          multilayer perceptron looks like.</p>

      <div id="rnn">
        <h2>Recurrent Neural Network</h2>
        <p>A Recurrent Neural Network is a type of artificial neural network in
          which the output of a particular layer is saved and fed back to the
          input. This helps predict the outcome of the layer.
          The first layer is formed in the same way as it is in the feedforward
          network. That is, with the product of the sum of the weights and
          features. However, in subsequent layers, the recurrent neural network
          process begins.
          From each time-step to the next, each node will remember some
          information that it had in the previous time-step. In other words,
          each node acts as a memory cell while computing and carrying out
          operations. The neural network begins with the front propagation as
          usual but remembers the information it may need to use later.
          If the prediction is wrong, the system self-learns and works towards
          making the right prediction during the backpropagation. This type of
          neural network is very effective in text-to-speech conversion
          technology.  Here’s what a recurrent neural network looks like.</p>
