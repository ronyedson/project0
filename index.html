        <h1>What is a neural network?</h1>
        <p>A neural network is a type of machine learning which models itself
          after the human brain, creating an artificial neural network that via
          an algorithm allows the computer to learn by incorporating new data.
        </p>

        <p>While there are plenty of artificial intelligence algorithms these
          days, neural networks are able to perform what has been termed deep
          learning. While the basic unit of the brain is the neuron, the
          essential building block of an artificial neural network is a
          perceptron which accomplishes simple signal processing, and these are
          then connected into a large mesh network.
        </p>

        <p>The computer with the neural network is taught to do a task by
          having it analyze training examples, which have been previously
          labeled in advance. A common example of a task for a neural network
          using deep learning is an object recognition task, where the neural
          network is presented with a large number of objects of a certain
          type, such as a cat, or a street sign, and the computer, by analyzing
          the recurring patterns in the presented images, learns to categorize
          new images.
